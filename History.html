            <h3> History of Nepal</h3>
            <p>Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multiracial, multicultural, multi-religious, and multilingual country. The most
                spoken language is Nepali followed by several other ethnic languages.The modern day Kingdom of Nepal was
                established in 1768 and started a campaign of unifying what would form the modern territories of Nepal.
                Some former territories had been lost due to the Sino-Nepalese War. The conflict ended with both
                victories and losses with the kingdom ultimately accepting tributary status with the Qing dynasty of
                China from 1792 to 1865.[1] The Anglo-Nepalese War ended in British victory and resulted in the ceding
                some Nepalese territory in the Treaty of Sugauli. In a historical vote for the election of the
                constituent assembly, the Nepalese parliament voted to abolish the monarchy in June 2006. Nepal became a
                federal republic on 28 May 2008 and was formally renamed the 'Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal'
                ending the 200-year-old reign of the Shah monarchs..</p>
            <h3 class="h2">Kingdom of Nepal</h3>
            <p>After decades of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms, modern Nepal was unified in the latter half of
                the 18th century, when Prithvi Narayan Shah, the ruler of the small principality of Gorkha, formed a
                unified country from a number of independent hill high states. After the death of Prithvi Narayan Shah,
                the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into much of the Indian subcontinent. Between 1788 and
                1791, during the Sino-Nepalese War, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse.
                Alarmed, the Qianlong Emperor of the Chinese Qing Dynasty appointed Fuk'anggan commander-in-chief of the
                Tibetan campaign; Fuk'anggan signed a treaty to protect his troops thus attaining a draw. After 1800,
                the heirs of Prithvi Narayan Shah proved unable to maintain firm political control over Nepal. A period
                of internal turmoil followed. The rivalry between Nepal and the British East India Company over the
                princely states bordering Nepal and British-India eventually led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814â€“16), in
                which Nepal suffered substantial losses due to lack of guns and ammunitions against the British-Indian
                forces with advanced weapons. The Treaty of Sugauli was signed in 1816, ceding large parts of the
                Nepalese controlled territories to the British. In 1860 some parts of western Terai, known as Naya Muluk
                (new country) was restored to Nepal. The four noble families involved largely in the active politics of
                the kingdom were the Shah rulers, the Thapas, the Basnyats, and the Pandes before the rise of the Rana
                dynasty.[31] From beginning to the mid of 18th century, the Thapas and Pandes had extreme dominance over
                Nepalese Darbar politics alternatively contesting for central power amongst each other </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Nepalese Civil War</h3>
            <p>In March 1997, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) started a bid to replace the parliamentary monarchy
                with a new people's democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the people's
                war, which led to the Nepalese Civil War. Led by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (also
                known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: Rolpa, Rukum, Jajarkot, Gorkha,
                and Sindhuli. The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) established a provisional "people's government" at
                the district level in several locations. On June 1, 2001, Prince Dipendra, went on a shooting-spree,
                assassinating 9 members of the royal family, including King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, before
                shooting himself. Due to his survival, he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds, after
                which Prince Gyanendra (King Birendra's brother) inherited the throne, as per tradition. Meanwhile, the
                rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete
                control of it. A week later he reappointed another government, but the country was still very unstable.
                Large parts of Nepal were taken over by the rebellion. The Maoists are driving out representatives of
                parties close to the government, expropriating local "capitalists" and implementing their own
                development projects. They also run their own prisons and courts. In addition to coercive measures, the
                guerrillas are gaining a foothold because of their popularity with large sectors of Nepalese society,
                particularly women, untouchables and ethnic minorities. Caste discrimination was abolished, women
                received equal inheritance rights and forced marriages were prohibited. In addition, the Maoists
                provided free health care and literacy classes. </p>
