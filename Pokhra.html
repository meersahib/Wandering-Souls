      <h1>Special Street Food </h1>
      <h3>Didoo</h3>
      <img src="./dhidoo.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Dhindo is a meal prepared in Nepal. It is prepared by gradually adding flour to boiling water while stirring.
        It is a staple meal in various parts of Nepal, specially Tamangs in the Hilly Region of Nepal [1] and the Sikkim
        and Darjeeling regions of India. Though it is a staple food in Nepal, dhindo has previously been seen as an
        inferior food compared to rice, and was associated with low status.[2] The inclusion of dhindo on urban
        restaurant menus has coincided with a rise in the food's prestige,[3] possibly attributable to the changing
        perception of Nepal's indigenous crops, which are now recognized for their nutritional advantage.Dhindo is
        Optionally, chopped mutton can be added to the dhindo, or small pieces or powder of soft chhurpi.</p>

      <h3>Sel Roti</h3>
      <img src="./rolll.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>A fusion of doughnut and bagel, Sel Roti is one of the most sought after snack in Nepal during festivals like
        Tihar and Dashain. It is a circular rice flour bread which is deeply fried to make it crunchy on the outside and
        soft on the inside. It is crispy and sweet and tastes best with yoghurt or veggies. Being a popular festival
        food in Nepal, this dish is a must on your culinary bucket list. It is made of rice flour with added flavours. A
        batter is prepared by adding water, sugar, and ghee to roughly grinded rice flour. The ghee can also be
        substituted by cooking oil or butter.. Once the batter is set, it is deep fried in cooking oil or ghee. Instead
        of water, milk can also be used to prepare the batter. However, using milk can reduce the shelf life of the
        dish. A woman cooking sel roti in a traditional Nepalese wooden stove A woman cooking sel roti in a traditional.</p>

      <h3>Wo or Bara</h3>
      <img src="./chapati.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Wo is a kind of pancakes made by the Newari people of Nepal. The Newaris are an indigenous group of locals in
        the Kathmandu valley. Wo is made with ground lentil (green or black) batter during the 'Sithi Nakha', a Newari
        festival. These Dal patties are light and perfect for snacks. For non-vegetarians, Bara can also be added with
        minced chicken and battered egg.Lentils are a staple in my pantry for many reasons and I am happy to add a new
        lentil-based recipe to my repertoire as it can be enjoyed as a quick meal or an appetizer. Lentil Pancake
        {Newari Bara, Wo:} is made with split black lentils with skin on, however I had split black lentils without the
        skin in my pantry so I used that kind. If you use split black lentils with skin, make sure to separate the skin
        and discard it otherwise, your final pancake won’t turn out correctly.</p>

    <div class="khana4">
      <h3>Yomari</h3>
      <img src="./pitthi.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Yomari are a steamed sweet rice-dumpling snack made by the Newari ethnic community, mainly associated with a
        festival in December held in their honor, Yomari Punhi. During this festival, which marks the end of the rice
        harvest, women make the fluffy dumplings that (vaguely) resemble fish. They’re made from homemade rice flour
        stuffed with jaggery, sesame paste or coconut fillings, and steamed. Why they’re shaped like fish is unknown (or
        lost to history), although special attention is paid to shaping the “tail,” as it is believed that the longer
        the tail, the shorter the winter will be. During the festival, yomari are offered to the gods, and also enjoyed
        with friends and relatives. Luckily for visitors to Kathmandu, there are select places to get this festival food
        any time of the year. While Nepali cuisine is full of savoury meals and snacks, yomari are a rarer sweet treat,
        and definitely worth seeking out while in Kathmandu. </p>
