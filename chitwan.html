            <h5>2. Jalbire Waterfall </h5>
            <h2> Lamo Jharna </h2>
            <img src="./chitwan/jalbirer.jpg" alt="image">
            <p>After a 20 minutes or a kilometer walk from Jalbire Temple situated on Muglin-Narayangarh Highway, we reach Chandi Vhanjhyang ward no-9 where you'll find Lamo Jharna (waterfall). Filled with flat grasslands one of the boons to Chitwan is this fall. Approximately 60 meter tall the water strikes the rocks directly at the bottom and seems to be like the water from heaven. Green hills' panoramic scene adds up more beauty to this fall.
                Likewise three small ponds provide us with opportunity to get recreated in fresh water. Though under shadowed on the way to this naturally gifted place visitors get a chance to explore Gurung villages and culture of this ethnic. Provided the required attention, this naturally gifted area can enrich national economy by conduction of home-stay programs. The area around this Lamo Jharna needs to be embedded with a park if possible for its sustainability in the way it is today.
                <strong>Transportation</strong>
                The water fall lies in Jalbire (Narayangarh - Mugling Highway) of Chitwan, which is 6km towards Narayangarh from Mugling and 30km towards Mugling from Narayangarh. There is no specific transportation to Jalbire, that's why you have to hire a jeep/car or catch express buses that runs in this highway. </p>

            <h5>3. DevGhat </h5>
            <h2> Famous Ghat </h2>
            <img src="./chitwan/devghat.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Devghat in Chitwan district is a prominent pilgrimage site situated at the holy confluence of the major rivers, Kali Gandaki and Trishuli which includes such large tributaries as the Seti, Budhi Gandaki and Madi. The confluence is located at a point about 5 km northwest of Narayanghat town where the rivers emerge from the Mahabharat range and flow into the plains. Rechristened the Narayani River, it then flows to India as the Gandak River to finally join the Ganges near Patna in the Indian state of Bihar. For Hindus, any confluence of rivers is considered a holy site.  
                Devghat is mentioned in several Hindu Scriptures such as the Baraha Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana and the Himavatkhanda. The area surrounding the confluence is densely forested by sal trees. A large number of shrines, temples, ashrams and old age homes have been built at Devghat. The most prominent is the Chakreshwar Temple where the famed King Mukunda Sen of Palpa is said to have meditated and attained Nirvana in the 16th century. A huge religious fair is held at the site on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, the first day of the Nepalese month of Magh, in January. Devotees and pilgrims from all over Nepal and adjoining India come here to take a ritual dip at the confluence.
                Many elderly devout Hindus have their winter homes in this sacred area, and some of them stay here to spend their last days in the belief that breathing their last here will assure them a place in Heaven. Throughout the day and night, Devghat resounds with the ringing of bells and the singing of hymns, or bhajans, in the temples and ashrams. </p>

The temple was again damaged in a devastating earthquake of 7.8 magnitude on Baisakh 12, 2072 BS. One year after the earthquake, President Bidhya Devi Bhandari had inaugurated the reconstruction work on Baisakh 12, 2073 BS. Now the reconstruction work has been completed and its inauguration work has been completed in Kartik 2077 BS.Ranipokhari, located in the centre of Kathmandu, is a man-made pond. It is surrounded by a clock tower and the Tri Chandra College in the east, which were built by Shri Teen Bir Shamsher Rana and Shri Teen Chandra Shamsher Rana respectively. Likewise, to the west of Rani Pokhari is Durbar High School, one of the oldest schools in Nepal built by Junga Bahadur Rana. Similarly, to the north of this pond is Biswajyoti Cinema and Ratna Park to the south. There is a temple of Balagopal Mahadev in the middle of Rani Pokhari. This temple is open only one day in a year on the day of Bhai Tika. Ranipokhari is surrounded by an iron fence. Inside the fence of Ranipokhari, a large elephant and a statue of King Pratap Malla, queen and son have been installed on it.</p>
