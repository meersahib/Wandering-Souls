            <img class="img2" src="./Visit/sarang.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pg2">The Ward is located on Sarangkot, a hill on the western side of Pokhara with an altitude of
                1600m. Sarangkot is known for its panoramic Himalayan views of Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu. It
                also provides an expansive view of the city of Pokhara, from the extreme north to the south including
                Phewa Lake. Tourists drive up the hill to watch the sunrise from the view tower at the top. In recent
                years, Sarangkot has been called one of the best paragliding locations in the world. The hike up from
                the Pokhara Baglung highway at Miruwa to Sarangkot takes 90 minutes to 1.5hours</p>

                part of Nepal just about 57 km from Pokhara and 262 Kilometers off from Kathmandu.. The place is famous
                for catenary suspension footbridge, which is one of the world’s highest of it’s type. And it was opened
                in early 2010. Now, the newly built Bungee and Swing has got attention among the internal as well as
                international tourists. And it is the highest bungee and swing in Nepal and second highest in the world.

            <p class="pg4">The Shanti stupa (1115m) in Pokhara, also known as the World Peace Pagoda, is a must-see
                popular tourist destination in the beautiful Pokhara city. Nichidatsu Fujii and villagers built it in
                1947 as a monument of international peace. After meeting Mahatma Gandhi in 1931, he was impressed by
                Gandhi’s nonviolent methods for achieving great goals.. The Shanti Stupa is situated in the front of
                Lakeside, Pokhara’s most popular tourist destination, on a mountaintop overlooking Fewa Lake.The Shanti

                on, a few casinos, most of them illegal, continued operating in different parts of Nepal. More casino

            <h1>Special Street Food </h1>
            <h3 class="text1">1.  Didoo</h3>
            <img class="khana1"src="./Food/dhidoo.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pag1">Dhindo is a meal prepared in Nepal. It is prepared by gradually adding flour to boiling water while
                stirring. It is a staple meal in various parts of Nepal, specially Tamangs in the Hilly Region of Nepal
                [1] and the Sikkim and Darjeeling regions of India. Though it is a staple food in Nepal, dhindo has
                previously been seen as an inferior food compared to rice, and was associated with low status.[2] The
                inclusion of dhindo on urban restaurant menus has coincided with a rise in the food's prestige,[3]
                possibly attributable to the changing perception of Nepal's indigenous crops, which are now recognized
                for their nutritional advantage.Dhindo is traditionally prepared from ground buckwheat or millet, but
                corn meal is common as well. Theoretically, any flour can be used to make dhindo, as it is essentially a
                simple mixture of hot water and ground grain. Optionally, chopped mutton can be added to the dhindo, or
                small pieces or powder of soft chhurpi.</p>

            <img class="khana2" src="./Food/rolll.jpeg" alt="">
            <p class="pag2">A fusion of doughnut and bagel, Sel Roti is one of the most sought after snack in Nepal during festivals
                like Tihar and Dashain. It is a circular rice flour bread which is deeply fried to make it crunchy on
                the outside and soft on the inside. It is crispy and sweet and tastes best with yoghurt or veggies.
                Being a popular festival food in Nepal, this dish is a must on your culinary bucket list. It is made of
                rice flour with added flavours. A batter is prepared by adding water, sugar, and ghee to roughly grinded
                rice flour. The ghee can also be substituted by cooking oil or butter.. Once the batter is set, it is
                deep fried in cooking oil or ghee. Instead of water, milk can also be used to prepare the batter.
                However, using milk can reduce the shelf life of the dish. A woman cooking sel roti in a traditional

            <img class="khana3" src="./Food/chapati.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pag3">Wo is a kind of pancakes made by the Newari people of Nepal. The Newaris are an indigenous group of
                locals in the Kathmandu valley. Wo is made with ground lentil (green or black) batter during the 'Sithi
                Nakha', a Newari festival. These Dal patties are light and perfect for snacks. For non-vegetarians, Bara
                can also be added with minced chicken and battered egg.Lentils are a staple in my pantry for many
                reasons and I am happy to add a new lentil-based recipe to my repertoire as it can be enjoyed as a quick
                meal or an appetizer. Lentil Pancake {Newari Bara, Wo:} is made with split black lentils with skin on,
                however I had split black lentils without the skin in my pantry so I used that kind. If you use split
                black lentils with skin, make sure to separate the skin and discard it otherwise, your final pancake
                won’t turn out correctly.</p>
            <h1 class="text4">4.  Yomari</h1>
            <img class="khana4" src="./Food/pitthi.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="pag4">Yomari are a steamed sweet rice-dumpling snack made by the Newari ethnic community, mainly associated
                with a festival in December held in their honor, Yomari Punhi. During this festival, which marks the end
                of the rice harvest, women make the fluffy dumplings that (vaguely) resemble fish. They’re made from
                homemade rice flour stuffed with jaggery, sesame paste or coconut fillings, and steamed. Why they’re
                shaped like fish is unknown (or lost to history), although special attention is paid to shaping the
                “tail,” as it is believed that the longer the tail, the shorter the winter will be. During the festival,
                yomari are offered to the gods, and also enjoyed with friends and relatives. Luckily for visitors to
                Kathmandu, there are select places to get this festival food any time of the year. While Nepali cuisine
                is full of savoury meals and snacks, yomari are a rarer sweet treat, and definitely worth seeking out
                while in Kathmandu. </p>
