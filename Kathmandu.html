            <h5>1. Durban Square </h5>
            <h2>Temple</h2>
            <img src="./Durban_Square.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Kathmandu Durbar Square, also known as Basantapur Durbar and Hanuman Dhoka, is an old durbar square in
                Kathmandu's city center. In the heart of old Kathmandu city, Basantapur never fails to impress first
                time visitors with its intricate wood carvings and rich history. Hanuman Dhoka was built during the
                Licchavi period (4th to 8th centuries AD), and King Pratap Malla extended the property significantly in
                the 17th century. With the highest concentration of old structures, the square is home to several
                palaces, courtyards, and temples. It is also known as "the Museum of Temples" because there are over 50
                temples in the square. Handicraft shops may be found in the courtyards around Gaddi Baithak, where you
                can see a variety of attractive purchasable handicrafts. Among the 50 temples that lie in the vicinity,
                lies the temple of the titular deity, Taleju Bhawani. The Durbar is divided into two courtyards, the
                outer Kasthamandap, Kumari Ghar, and Shiva-Parvati Temple, and the inner section consisting of Hanuman
                Dhoka and the main palace. Some floors have been converted to museums dedicated to three generations of
                Shah kings of Nepal. Most parts of the palace premises are open to tourists throughout the week. </p>

            <h2>Market</h2>
            <img src="./Thamel 2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The most well-known and active tourist destination in Nepal is Thamel, which is situated in the city’s
                center. This vibrant neighborhood is recognized for its short lanes filled with a diverse selection of
                stores, vendors, restaurants, and pubs. For more than a century, Thamel has been the hub of Kathmandu’s
                tourism industry and is a must-see location for visitors to Nepal. Since the hippie era, when many
                artists used to travel to Nepal using Hippie Trail and used to stay for weeks in Thamel, Thamel has been
                the epicenter of the tourism industry in Kathmandu. The Kathmandu valley’s main tourist destination is
                there. Thamel is renowned for its winding lanes crammed with a variety of shops and street sellers.

                woolen goods, and clothing are among the often sold things. Along the streets are also travel agencies,
                little grocery stores, low-cost hotels, dining establishments, and nightclubs. Alongside hundreds of
                pedestrians, cars, bicycle rickshaws, two-wheelers, and taxis navigate these congested streets. To
                prevent traffic and crowd chaos, some roads in Thamel have recently been designated as vehicle-free
                zones. </p>

            <h5>5. Boudhanath Stupa </h5>
            <h2>Tibetan Temple</h2>
            <img class="Image" src="./Stupa.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The village that surrounds the great Kāśyapa stupa is generally known by the name of Bauddha/ Boudha.
                ...which in Tibetan is called Yambu Chorten Chenpo Jya Rung Khashor Chorten Chenpo, literally which may
                be translated as "Chorten of poultry fallen promise" The stupa has an interesting history of its own
                which explains this strange name. In Buddhist tradition Kāśyapa or Kassapa Buddha was the Buddha who
                preceded Śākyamuni Buddha, the twenty-seventh of the twenty-nine named Buddhas, though he lived a long
                time before Śākyamuni. After Kāśyapa Buddha's demise, a certain old woman, a poultry keeper,
                Ma-jha-zi-ma (Tibetan: མ་བྱ་རྫི་མ། Wyle: ma bya rzi ma mother bird caretaker) with her four sons,
                interred this great sage's remains at the spot over which the great mound now stands, the latter having
                been built by the woman herself. Before starting on the work of construction, she petitioned the King of
                the time to grant her land the size of a buffalo skin. Thinking it would be small the king gave
                permission for land and to build her stupa. However the poultry woman carefully cut the skin in a long
                strip, like a rope and used it to circumscribe a large area. Prayer wheels, Boudhanath, 1973 By the time
                that, as a result of great sacrifices on the part of the woman and her four sons, the groundwork of the
                structure had been finished, those who saw it were astonished at the greatness of the scale on which it
                was undertaken. The high officials and wealthy people of the country were ashamed, if such a poor old
                woman were allowed to complete building such a stupendous tower, they themselves would have to dedicate
                a temple as great as a mountain, and so they decided to ask the King to disallow further progress of the
                work. When the King was approached on the matter his Majesty replied: "I have finished giving the order
                to the woman to proceed with the work. Kings must not eat their words, and I cannot undo my orders now"
                which is known as (Kha-Shor), mouth-fallen thus, the name came as Jya Rung Kha Shor. So the stupa was
                allowed to be finished, and hence its unique name, "Jya Rung Kha Shor Chorten Chenpo."</p>

            <h5>5. Garden of Dreams </h5>
            <h2>National Park </h2>
            <img src="./Garden-Dreams.jpg" alt="">
            <p>THE GARDEN OF DREAMS (SWAPNA Bagaicha) was the idyllic vision of Kaiser Sumsher Rana, a field marshal in
                the Royal Nepalese Army who ordered its creation on the grounds of his palatial home in 1920. Though the
                garden was severely neglected following his death in 1964, the exquisitely manicured landscapes and the
                surviving fountains, pergolas, and pavilions have since been restored to their former glory. The
                four-acre Garden of Dreams in Kathmandu was designed by landscape architect Kishore Narshingh to mimic
                Edwardian-era English gardens. Most notably, the site was characterized by six pavilions, which
                symbolized the “six seasons” of Nepal: spring, early summer, the summer monsoon season, early autumn,
                late autumn, and winter. In its heyday, the garden was considered one of the most remarkable feats of
                landscape design in the country. Today, visitors will only find three pavilions on just over an acre of
                land, but the 74,000 square-foot space remains a verdant attraction thanks to a restoration project
                spearheaded by the Austrian government and Nepal Ministry of Education. Through the garden’s original
                gates are picturesque fountains and ponds, an amphitheater, isolated gardens of varying sizes, and the
                Kaiser Café Restaurant & Bar. Meandering pathways are lined with hedges, plants, trees, and flowers from
                all over the world, complemented by charming stone urns and intricate benches that offer contemplative
                vistas.</p>
